Did you use AI? If you did, please share how you used it in this assignment. 
Vincent used AI to help him understand MIPS and catch up on lecture concepts he was not sure of (solidifying branch instructions, why NOP is needed, syntax for move and addiu vs addu) and also to understand and tracethrough heapsort.c. 
Ashley also used AI to explain the differences between sw and lw for restoring and loading values into the registers at the beginning and end of each function. This was a confusing concept from lecture. 
We used AI to debug specifically for 2 error types. 1) off by one error in heapsort because we were using the same temporary register for the size of the array and the index of the array for the swap function. 2) we needed another saved register s3 in heapify when it was originally a temporary register. This was causing an issue with not storing what we were expected to be seen and used in the next call.
