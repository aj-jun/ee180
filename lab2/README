Write a README file that contains the following:
- Your name, your partner's name, your board's host name (e.g. ee180-10z.stanford.edu)
Jun, Ashley
ajjun@stanford.edu
Thai, Vincent
thaiv47@stanford.edu

Board hostname: ee180-3z.stanford.edu

- Each partner's contribution to the assignment
Ashley:

Vincent:


- A brief description of optimizations you tried, the outcome, and some explanation (why it worked / why it did not)

- Report the final performance for both single thread and multithread (we will verify this with your code submission)

- If you used AI tools, explain how you use it to help with the assignment
Ashley: 
I used AI to help provide defintions when explaining the different compiler flags. This was particularly helpful when understadnignt aht we can specify which architecture and processor to optimize for in the flags.
